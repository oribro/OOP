=============================
This excerscise is about managing a store with products and customers, as we practice the usage of classes.
In this excercise we were required to implement 3 classes, each one I implemented according to the given API's.
I used different types of variables: int, string, and array of objects. I also implemented different methods
among the classes, all together contribute to the integrity of the "store system": the products in the store,
the customers, and the financial aspects that are being involved in the commerce.



=============================
=  Implementation details   =
=============================
In the Store class, I used an array of objects of ProductType as we were instructed in the API.
This allowed me to obtain easy access to the properties of each of the store's products.
