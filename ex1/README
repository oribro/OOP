Competition.java - Contains the competition class implementation and the main method of the program.
Board.java - Implements the Board class which represents the board of the nim game and details about it.
Move.java - Implements the Move class which represents a move made buy a player on the board.
Player.java - Implements the Player class which represents types of players that can play the game.

=============================
We were asked to implement the classes so that the output will be exactly the same as the school solution,
so thats what i did. In the Player class I used a private method "rowIsMarked" that checks if a given row is
marked in order to make the implementation of the smart and random players simpler. For Smart player see below.

=============================

I implemented the Smart player in the Player class in the following manner:
The key principle of this strategy is that after the game was played for some turns, only the last
row that was left with unmarked sticks matters. To secure the victory, we need to make sure that 
our opponent will make the last turn, and he will have only one stick left available to mark,
meaning that after his turn we will win because all the sticks on the board will be marked.
Then, it suffices in each turn to count the number of marked (unmarked) rows on the board, and as long as there
is more than 1 unmarked row, we produce a random move since only the case of 1 unmarked row matters.
When in some turn there is only 1 unmarked row left, we would like to mark the longest legal sequence we can mark
on this last unmarked row. If we succeed in producing a sequence longer than 1 stick, then we leave one stick 
unmarked so we improve our chances of winning. If 1 stick to mark is the only legal option, we will mark it and
try again in our next turn. 
This strategy performs better than the random because it focuses on the last moments of the game where the moves 
are crucial, where the random will keep randomly marking sticks.
